# Discord Profile Site

A minimalistic, red-themed website to display your Discord profile and activity.

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view your profile (static version).
2. For HTTPS local development, use a tool like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (for VS Code) or [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate a local certificate and serve with HTTPS.

## Customization
- Edit `index.html` and `style.css` to change the look or add more features.
- Discord integration uses public APIs or third-party services (see script.js, to be added).
